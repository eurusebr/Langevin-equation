# Langevin-equation
The Langevin equation is a mathematical equation that describes the motion of a particle under the influence of random forces, as well as deterministic forces such as friction. It is commonly used in the field of statistical mechanics to study the behavior of small particles in a fluid, or the behavior of particles in a magnetic field, the equation is expressed as follows:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}v(t) = -\eta v(t) + F(t) + \xi (t)
$$

where:

* $v(t)$ is the velocity of the particle at time $t$.
* $\eta$ is the friction coefficient, which represents the strength of the frictional force.
* $F(t)$ is the deterministic force acting on the particle.
* $Î¾(t)$ is a random force that represents the thermal fluctuations in the fluid or other surroundings. It is modeled as a Gaussian white noise term with zero mean and a certain variance.

The Langevin equation provides a description of the stochastic motion of a particle under the influence of both deterministic and random forces. It is useful in a wide range of applications, including the study of Brownian motion, the diffusion of particles in a fluid, and the dynamics of complex systems.
