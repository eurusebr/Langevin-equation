The Langevin equation is a mathematical equation that describes the motion of a particle under the influence of random forces, as well as deterministic forces such as friction. It is commonly used in the field of statistical mechanics to study the behavior of small particles in a fluid, or the behavior of particles in a magnetic field, the equation is expressed as follows:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}v(t) = -\eta v(t) + F(t) + \xi (t)
$$

where:

* $v(t)$ is the velocity of the particle at time $t$.
* $\eta$ is the friction coefficient, which represents the strength of the frictional force.
* $F(t)$ is the deterministic force acting on the particle.
* $ξ(t)$ is a random force that represents the thermal fluctuations in the fluid or other surroundings. It is modeled as a Gaussian white noise term with zero mean and a certain variance.

The Langevin equation provides a description of the stochastic motion of a particle under the influence of both deterministic and random forces. It is useful in a wide range of applications, including the study of Brownian motion, the diffusion of particles in a fluid, and the dynamics of complex systems.

The Fokker-Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the probability density function (PDF) of a particle's position and velocity over time. However, solving this equation analytically can be challenging, especially for complex systems.

One way to approximate the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is through the use of many Langevin trajectories. In this approach, one considers a large number of particles that are subject to the same deterministic and random forces, as described by the Langevin equation. The PDF of the particle positions and velocities can then be approximated by the distribution of the particles' positions and velocities in the ensemble of Langevin trajectories.

To be more precise, one considers a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) realizations of the stochastic process described by the Langevin equation. The distribution of particle positions and velocities at a given time is then given by the histogram of the particle positions and velocities in the ensemble of trajectories.

One can then use this histogram to estimate the PDF of the particle positions and velocities. This PDF can be updated over time by considering the evolution of the particle positions and velocities in the ensemble of Langevin trajectories. By evolving the PDF in this way, one can obtain an approximation of the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation.

This method of approximating the Fokker-Planck equation through many Langevin trajectories is known as the Monte Carlo method and is widely used in various fields, including physics, chemistry, and finance.

# Results

In this code, I have taken the Langvan equation and implemented a simulation to determine its behavior. By using this simulation, I have then approximated the Fokker-Planck equation, which provides insight into the distribution of the system's states over time. Additionally, the simulation visualizes three representative trajectories out of the total 10,000 generated, and provides the mean and variance of the average of all trajectories. These results give us an understanding of the stability and fluctuations of the system under investigation.
